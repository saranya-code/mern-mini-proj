// Create a MERN stack app that displays a list of 10 users
// Use Mongo seeding to seed the database with your list
// Create the back-end:
    User model with these fields: Name, Email, Age, Role (Admin or User)
    Basic CRUD routes (GET all, GET single, Update, Delete, Create)

// In React:
    -The home page should list all the users in a table-like format. We should be able to sort by name or email
    -Clicking on the person's name should lead to a Detail page for that user
    -At the top of the home page should be link to create a new user, which will have a form to complete
    -Submitting the form creates a new user, then returns the person back to the home page
    -Also on the home page table should be an X to delete a user
